This mini can detect foot faults and call out players for excessive time and don't require the players to make a call. It consists of an arduino, 
pressure sensor, LEDs, a buzzer and a wireless transceiver. The wireless transceiver allows it to communicate with another arduino connected
to several relays to enforce the PDGA rules.

A detailed breakdown and demonstration is available on YouTube
